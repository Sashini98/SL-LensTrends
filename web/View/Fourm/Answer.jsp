                <p>You unfortunately have very little control over the iPhone camera. You can only lock or unlock the exposure, white balance, and focus modes.
                    Camera+ actually does not have control over anything you described. It used to be able to as it hacked the hardware, which is naturally a great way to get your app rejected by the reviewers.
                    I hope that iOS6 will give developers greater control as it is a PITA.</p>
